# Trends-Tool
A high-level abstraction text mining tool

The primary purpose of this tool is to make meaningful segmenting of textual data like tweets or articles a task done without programming or any technical process specifications.
The tool is meant to make the process only about domain knowledge of the analyst, excluding any technical know how.

The current state of the tool has been uploaded and is still a work in progress.
What is be√Øng done right now is making the tool well explained in github and accesible for contributors.

Things to be implemented in this step:
  * Conceptual overview of current application state:
    - Data structures
    - Class diagram
    - More documentation in general
  * Accesabillity:
    - An installation guide on how to start using the current state of the tool in getting all libraries installed and the application running properly

The first upload was done without all of this so that these processes are also documented in the git hub repository.
